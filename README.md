Prior to applying Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), structural brain connectivity matrices were loaded from atlas-based diffusion MRI tractography (DK68, Schaefer100, Schaefer200) and converted into weighted, undirected graphs. Graph-theoretic properties were characterized, including density, degree and strength distributions, Laplacian spectra, and community structure via Louvain modularity. Based on the empirical DK68 connectome, two classes of synthetic region-wise time series were generated: (i) a linear diffusion process driven by the graph Laplacian with additive noise, and (ii) a nonlinear Hopf oscillator network with coupling defined by the structural connectivity. For Hopf dynamics, an initial transient was discarded to retain steady-state oscillations. The resulting atlas-parcellated regional time series (regions × time) were saved as preprocessed inputs for subsequent Koopman-based analysis using DMD and Hankel-DMD.
DMD is applied to preprocessed regional fMRI time series (N regions × T time points) stored in `data/processed/`. For Hopf dynamics, the signals are mean-centered and optionally delay-embedded (Hankel-DMD) prior to decomposition. DMD outputs complex temporal coordinates, whose real and imaginary components are saved as low-dimensional latent state variables and used as inputs for SINDy.
